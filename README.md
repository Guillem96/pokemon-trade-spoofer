### Pokemon Trading State Machine ðŸŽ°

Pokemon trades involve a several [amount of states](https://blog.gbplay.io/2021/05/11/Emulating-a-Pokemon-Trade-with-Generated-Link-Cable-Data.html) 
(connecting with player, waiting in trade room, exchange random seed, etc...).

Managing those states and its associated behavior with `if` `else` statements is a pain in the ass. 
Engaging the developer to use bad practices and code smells like global states. 
Moreover, the code rapidly becomes hard and follow for people trying to go through it. 
Therefore, I decided to implement this logic of switching states and behaviors using a 
slight modification of the State pattern defined [here](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StateMachine.html).

State Machine Components:

- `State`: Has a `run` method which implements the behavior of the according state and 
returns an instance of the next state. Additionally, the `run` method receives a `Context`
object as a parameter. 

- `Context`: Contains the state machine shared information. In our case: the Pokemon to be traded, 
the received party from the other player, etc.

- `StateMachine`: The state machine itself is the owner of the `Context` and keeps a reference
to the current state. Every time, the `State.run` returns, the state machine manages the
execution of the new state.
