### Pokemon Trading State Machine üé∞

Pokemon trades involve a several [amount of states](https://blog.gbplay.io/2021/05/11/Emulating-a-Pokemon-Trade-with-Generated-Link-Cable-Data.html)
(connecting with player, waiting in trade room, exchange random seed, etc...).

Managing those states and its associated behavior with `if` `else` statements is a pain in the ass.
Engaging the developer to use bad practices and code smells like global states.
Moreover, the code rapidly becomes hard and follow for people trying to go through it.
Therefore, I decided to implement this logic of switching states and behaviors using a
slight modification of the State pattern defined [here](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StateMachine.html).

State Machine Components:

- `State`: Has a `run` method which implements the behavior of the according state and
  returns an instance of the next state. Additionally, the `run` method receives a `Context`
  object as a parameter.

- `Context`: Contains the state machine shared information. In our case: the Pokemon to be traded,
  the received party from the other player, etc.

- `StateMachine`: The state machine itself is the owner of the `Context` and keeps a reference
  to the current state. Every time, the `State.run` returns, the state machine manages the
  execution of the new state.

See in the image below the state machine implemented:

### Frontend ‚öõ

The frontend is a desktop application developed in [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/es/).
To communicate the electron frontend with the python package running the backends (BGB, ...), I developed a
management REST API leveraging [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (See section below).

The desktop application comes bundled with a Python executable build with
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). This Python executable is basically
the `pkm_trade_spoofer` "packaged" with all dependencies so it can be run everywhere.

At launch, electron app spawns a process running the aforementioned Management
API, then as usual, a window with a web interface (built with HTML, CSS and typescript)
pops, so the user can easily interact with the Pokemon trade spoofer.

Check the implementation under the [desktop-app](desktop-app) directory.

### Management API

This REST API provides an intuitive HTTP interface to manage the execution of the backends.

It only provides two endpoints:

- `/start-backend`: Starts the execution of a backend.
- `/stop-backend`: Gracefully stops the execution of a backend.

Check the implementation [here](pkm_trade_spoofer/api.py).
